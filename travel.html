		<h2> My Favorite Places to Travel </h2>

		<p> These are three of the places where I love to spend my time. </p>

		<h3> Hawaii </h3>
		<p> There are many sight-seeing places and beautiful views in Hawaii. My family and I go there every other year to relax on the beach and swim in the warm waters. We also like to visit the numerous waterfalls and caves. </p>

		<h3> India </h3>
		<p> A lot of my family still lives in India, so we go there every other year to visit them. I live with my cousins and we get to hang out. I also get to talk with my grandmas. In addition, there are many tourist spots like Goa and Taj Mahal. </p>

		<h3> Disneyland </h3>
		<p> There are many fun rides in Disneyland, as well as creative themes and yummy food. My family and I used to go there every other year when I was younger. After Disneyland, we used to go to Universal Studios as well, which is an hour or two away. </p>
